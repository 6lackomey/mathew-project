<h1>GHANIAN CULTURE NAMES</h1>
<P>Ghanaian names (or personal names in Ghana) consist of several given names and surnames based on the language of ethnic groups in Ghana: including Akan, Mole-Dagombas, Ga, Ewe and Nzema. Frequently, children are given a "day name" which corresponds to the day in the week when they were born.
</P>
<p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child's name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender.</p>
